# Fake-Reviews-Detection

## Problem Statement

Detection of fake reviews out of a massive collection of reviews having various distinct categories like Home and Office, Sports, etc. with each review having a corresponding rating, label i.e. CG(Computer Generated Review) and OR(Original Review generated by humans) and the review text.

Main task is to detect whether a given review is fraudulent or not. If it is computer generated, it is considered fake otherwise not.

## Description

 Description: The generated fake reviews dataset, containing 20k fake reviews and 20k real product reviews. OR = Original reviews (presumably human created and authentic); CG = Computer-generated fake reviews.
